Dear Sir or Madame.

With this letter, I would like to express my interest on the post advertised for C/C++ software Developer.

I'm a Portuguese student, awaiting for the discussion of his master thesis (which has to happen before the 31st of May), who's intention is to transfer to the Turin Area, where I intent to live and work. My master's degree in computer networks has prepared me for the proposed position. From all the informatics courses that I attended, the ones that I found to be the most pertinent are the C courses and the object-oriented programming, in which I developed capacities with OO languages and C. Most recently I have been making my transition into C++ through several own projects in order to make it my principal programming language. 

I'm a fast learner with a will that forces me to improve myself everyday and a developer that enjoys challenging projects to give its all. I hope to be able to take on this opportunity to pave my way into the working world and prove to you that I am capable of being an important asset to your company.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours sincerely
Ricardo Martins



Dear Sir or Madame.

With this letter, I would like to express my interest on the post advertised for Java  Developer.

I'm a Portuguese student who's intention is to finish his master thesis by the first half of March and transfer myself to the Turin Area, where I intent to live and work. My master's degree in computer networks has prepared me for the proposed position. From all the informatics courses that I attended, the ones that I found to be the most pertinent are the C courses and the object-oriented programming, in which I developed capacities with OO languages and C. These courses allowed to interact with many different features such as multithreading, parallel and distributed computation and existent algorithms. Most recently I have been making my transition into C++ through several own projects in order to learn a new language by self making use of my C and OO knowledge. At this point in life I have completed three android application, two for university, a Briscola Wi-Fi direct game and an indoor location app for my master thesis. The third application is now in the last phase of development and it’s an application to function as a support in the learning process of a relaxing technique, Autogenous training.

I'm a fast learner with a will that forces me to improve myself everyday and a developer that enjoys challenging projects to give its all. I hope to be able to take on this opportunity to pave my way into the working world and prove to you that I am capable of being an important asset to your company.

Dear Sir or Madame.

With this letter, I would like to express my interest on the position for Junior Graphics Developer.

I'm a Portuguese student, awaiting for the discussion of his master thesis (which has to happen before the 31st of May), who's intention is to transfer to the Turin Area, where I intent to live and work. My master's degree in Electrical and Computer engineering introduced me to C, Java and Android, often times with a focus on networking. From all the informatics courses that I attended, the ones that I found to be the most pertinent are the C, databases and internet systems courses, where I was capable of working with C, mySQL and Rest, respectfully. 

In the last year, I have attempted to test and improve myself, firstly through Android, which i needed for my master thesis (BLE indoor location system application), having created an application to function as a support in the learning process of a relaxing technique, Autogenous training. Secondly, make use of C to make a transition onto C++. Through my passion for gaming, I set a series of projects that would steadily allow me to improve. At this point in time, I’m on my third project, having started with a Sudoku and a Chess program using nothing but SDL, and currently finishing a Mahjong program, using SDL and OpenGL. Although this journey was set as an hobby, it showed me the complexity and interest of the graphics component. 

This position caught my attention for its challenging component and enticing scope. 
I consider myself to be a fast learner with a will that forces me to improve myself everyday and a developer that enjoys challenging projects.  

I hope to be able to take on this opportunity to pave my way into the working world and prove to you that I am capable of being an important asset to your company.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours sincerely,
